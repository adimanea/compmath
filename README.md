# Computational (Computer) Mathematics

This started from my initiative to learn some computational computer mathematics
for myself and then I thought I should add some teaching component to it.

As such, while I'm learning, the focus will be to cover subjects that are in
the syllabi of the courses and seminars I teach at the Politehnica University
of Bucharest.

Expected to feature, in no particular order and without anticipating about complexity
and thoroughness:
- Linear algebra;
- Real, Complex and Vector Analysis;
- Differential Equations;
- Partial Differential Equations;
- 2D and 3D Geometry;
- Basic Statistics and Probability Theory;
- Graphs and Data Visualisation;
- Cryptography.

*I will also be focusing on symbolic computations more than on numerical ones*,
except for the statistics and probabilities part.

I will try to use what I find as the most suitable tools for the tasks at hand
and which also suit my abilities. An important focus will be to use free and
open source software and code exclusively.

I will update this file with an index of the main subjects and files as
I write them.

- the `setup.org` file in the current directory sketches the initial setup.
